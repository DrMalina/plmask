# PL-Mask

A multi-page website for a company selling
protective masks in Poland. I used this project as an opportunity to learn
Gatsby.js for the first time and try out some new CSS framework - Tailwind CSS. The site uses
headless CMS for the owner to manage the company's products.

## Technologies

Project is created with:

- Gatsby.js
